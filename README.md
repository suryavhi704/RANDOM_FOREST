🌲 Random Forest Classifier - Optimized with GridSearchCV:

Welcome to the Random Forest Classifier Project, where machine learning meets optimization! 🚀 This project implements a robust Random Forest Classifier using Scikit-learn, while leveraging GridSearchCV to fine-tune hyperparameters for the best possible model performance. If you're passionate about data science and want to see how a classifier can be optimized, you're in the right place! 🎯

📌 Project Overview:-

In this project, I built a powerful Random Forest Classifier to predict outcomes from a dataset. The goal was not just to create a model but to maximize accuracy using the hyperparameter tuning capabilities of GridSearchCV.

✨ Features:-

✅ Random Forest Classifier implementation from sklearn
✅ Data handling & preprocessing using pandas & numpy
✅ Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
✅ Performance evaluation using accuracy score & confusion matrix
✅ Well-structured, modular, and reusable code

🛠️ Technologies Used:-

Python 🐍

Scikit-learn (sklearn) 🤖

Pandas 📊

NumPy 🔢

Matplotlib 📉

Seaborn 🌊


🔍 Model Optimization with GridSearchCV:-

One of the key highlights of this project is the implementation of GridSearchCV. This technique helps find the best combination of hyperparameters to enhance model performance.

Here's how it works:

Defines a grid of hyperparameters to test (e.g., number of estimators, max depth, etc.)

Evaluates multiple combinations using cross-validation

Selects the best model configuration based on performance metrics.

_Why GridSearchCV? 🔥

Automates hyperparameter tuning

Ensures the best performance with minimal overfitting

Saves time compared to manual tuning.

📊 Results & Performance:-

Achieved 80% accuracy after tuning (replace with your actual result)

Visualized feature importance using Seaborn

Compared different hyperparameter settings for better insights.
